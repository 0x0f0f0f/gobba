## 0.4.2 2020-01-??
### Added
- The REPL now has `readline` features by default (without the readline dependency) and more!
- REPL tab completion and hints.
- Optimized the primitive call abstraction
- Separated list and dictionary primitives in their appropriate modules `Dict` and `List`
- Fixed size vectors and characters
- A lot of improvements in the stdlib primitives.
- A cute mascotte called gamel
### Fixes
- Complex number parsing, allocation and arithmetics
- Operator precedence

## 0.4.1 2020-01-17
- Renamed project from minicaml to `gobba`!
- Syntax is now more haskel-ly: use `,` to separate list and dictionary values,
  use `>>` to sequence operations (bind) and use `;` to end statements.
- Improved purity inference algorithm with correct module inference
- Some minor improvements

## 0.4 2020-01-16
- Multiline REPL
- New dictionary syntax
- Static purity inference algorithm
- `map`, `foldl` and `foldr` are implemented in the language
- Integer division now returns a float if the modulo between the two numbers is 0
- Print the type in the REPL result
- Directives on the toplevel: `#include filename` and `#import` to load and run files,
  `#verbose n` to set a verbosity level, `#pure`, `#impure` and `#uncertain` to set the global purity context.
- Gobba and OCaml Stack traces on errors!
- Removed the `let rec` and `let rec lazy` statements.
- `lazy`-ness is now meant for each single assignment in a let statement, and they
  can be mixed; This is now valid: `let a = ... and lazy b = ... ;;`
- A LOT of internal optimizations.
- `Lambda` and `Closure` abstractions for function now have a single parameter
  and can be nested. This means that `(fun x y z -> ...) = (fun x -> (fun y -> (fun z -> ...)))` is now true, and the
  evaluation gets quite simplified (for example, in partial evaluation)
- Composition and reverse composition are back and working with `<=<` and `>=>`
- Purity inference is now done before evaluation
- Capability of recursion is now inferred automatically basing on the location of a `fun` expression.

## 0.3.3 2020-01-08
- Rely on the [Ramda.js](https://ramdajs.com/) library for JS transpilation.
  (Currently broken because of numerical primitives and a lack of a Complex
  number solution for Javascript).
- Full numerical tower comprising Integer (Natural) numbers, Floating Point (Real) numbers and
  Complex numbers, with dynamic number-type infering arithmetical primitives.
- Switch between pure and impure primitives.
- Simple I/O primitives for printing.
- More examples and features descriptions in the README file.

## 0.3.2 2019-01-03
### Added 
- Reworking of language internals.
- Fixed build process
- More primitives and operators.
- AST optimizations based on propositional calculus laws.
- Experimental Javascript transpiler! :)  

## 0.3.1 2019-12-26
### Added
- `map2` primitive
- Reading programs from files
- An abstraction that allows treating primitives as functions, and so allows
  currying and all the fancy stuff.
- Examples in the `examples/` directory
- *Greater or equal to* and *Less than or equal to* operators
- More test coverage.
### Bugfixes
- Fixed various bugs of 0.3

## 0.3 2019-12-25
### Added
- A simple AST optimizer
- Multiple let assignments (`let x = 2 and y = 3 and z = ... in ...`)
- Function currying (partial application)
- Strings
- Sequences of expressions separated with `;` are treated as a single expression
  that returns the value of the last one.
- Function pipelining (reverse composition) with the `>=>` operator.
  (`(fun x y -> x + y >=> g) 1 2` is `g 3`)
- Dictionaries (`{"hello": 123, "world": 345}`)
- Map, foldl and filter on lists and dictionaries
- Testing and code coverage using alcotest and bisect_ppx
### Bugfixes
- Fixed function application parser

## 0.2.2 2019-12-13
### Added
- `let lazy rec` (or `let rec lazy`) to define recursive lazy functions
- Command line option parser and man page
- Command line option `-v` (`--verbose`) to tell the REPL to show the AST and
  reduction steps.
- Evaluation step printing is now done in correct order and nesting. 
### Bugfixes
- Fixed boolean primitives.
### Removed
- `lazyfun` and `lazylambda` statements.

## 0.2.1 2019-12-12
### Added
- Optional `lazy` evaluation! You can use `let lazy` to define values that will
  be evaluated only when encountered in the `let lazy` expression body.
- Lazy anonymous functions! Just like the `let lazy` statement you can now use
  `lazyfun` or `lazylambda` to define anonymous functions which arguments will
  be lazily evaluated.
### Bugfixes
- Fixed precedence levels in parser
### Roadmap
- Cache for lazy evaluation
- Partial application

## 0.2 2019-12-08
### Added
- Lists
- Unit

## 0.1 2019-12-03
### Added
- Initial release of the project
